## Driving Code, with Tests
Aside from src/index.php, 100% of this code was driven by tests, which is how I achieved "100% coverage". Having said this, I don't test-drive code to achieve any "code coverage" percentage, I only do it to more quickly understand what I'm trying to deliver, more easily arrive at a solution, and in the end deliver better software, faster than I would without doing any testing whatsoever. A high "code coverage" percentage just happens to be a mere byproduct of this process.
